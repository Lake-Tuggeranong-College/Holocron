# Project Overview

This semester-long course introduces students to the fundamentals of networking and programming with the end-goal to build a secure automated home network.

The networking topics you will learn are:
- [[OSI Model]]
- TCP/IP
	- Subnet Masks
- Packet Tracer

The programming topics you will learn are:
- [[Internet of Things (IoT)]] devices
- Python programming
- Sensors (input)
- Actuators (output)


# Objectives

Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:

- Understand the OSI model and its role in network communication.
- Configure basic network settings on their computers.
- Subnet IP addresses and apply subnet masks.
- Identify different network topologies.
- Use Packet Tracer to simulate and troubleshoot network configurations.
- Code IoT devices to integrate sensors and actuators.


# Project Deliverables

There are three deliverables (assessments) for this project this semester.

1. Technical Documentation.
2. Home Network Design
3. Video Demonstration.
