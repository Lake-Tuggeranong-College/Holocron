# Terminal

Open the Terminal on your computer and change to the Downloads folder with the command:

```bash
cd Downloads
```

Then execute each of the following commands, one at a time. You may find you need to enter your account password after running [[sudo]] for the first time.

```bash
sudo apt update
```
```bash
sudo apt install ca-certificates curl
```
```bash
sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
```
```bash
sudo curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc
```
```bash
sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc
```
```bash
echo \
  "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
  $(. /etc/os-release && echo "${UBUNTU_CODENAME:-$VERSION_CODENAME}") stable" | \
  sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
```
```bash
sudo apt update
```
```bash
sudo apt install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin
```


Once that's completed install the desktop file with the command, and wait for it to finish:


```bash
sudo apt install ./docker-desktop-amd64.deb
```

>[!note] You may be presented with an error at the end of the installation process for this final step. You can ignore this.
