This shows the default code needed to create a new module using MQTT.

To implement a new module, create a new project using PlatformIO (extension within VSCode). 
Then:
1) replace the contents of `src/main.cpp` with the code shown,
2) add a new file called `sensitiveInformation.h` in the same `src` folder and replace contents with code shown.
3) Replace contents of `platform.ini` with the code shown.

After these steps, your project should appear similar to this:

![[moduleTemplate.png]]

# Next steps

Once the template is built and running on the ESP32, confirm it's reading updates from the subscribed mqttTopic. You will need to open the Serial Monitor for this.

After confirming that it works, add code in to read the sensor (if reuiqred) and to act on the updated data from the server (`(char)payload[i]`)

# Code 
## `sensitiveInformation.h`

```cpp
/*
 * Contains any sensitive Infomration that you do not want published to Github.
 * 
 * The SSID and Password variables will need to be changed if youâ€™re connecting to another Wireless Access Point (such as at home).
 *
 * This file is supposed to be in the .gitignore
 * 
 */


// Wifi network
const char* ssid = "CyberRange";       // Wifi Network Name
const char* password = "CyberRange";  // Wifi Password

// MQTT client name
const char* mqttClient = "ESP32";

// MQTT Topic
const char* mqttTopic = "RegisteredModules/Servo"; // It's worth noting that an ESP32 can subscribe to more than 1 topic

// Replace with the MQTT broker IP address and port (default port for MQTT is 1883)
const char* mqttServer = "192.168.1.10";  
const int mqttPort = 1883;

```


## `main.cpp`

```cpp
/*
  This is a template for all ESP32's using MQTT within the CyberRange.
  Read through the steps and ensure everything is setup correctly.
  This is made such that programming physical functions is as easy as possible.
  Old CyberCitySharedFunctionality stuff has been removed.
*/

/*
  This works using the MQTT broker (mosquitto, installed on the CyberRange server), in combination with the database,
  and the databaseToMQTT.py script, setup as a service on the CyberRange server. The script detects any changes to the 
  'RegisteredModules/CurrentOutput' column, and sends them to the broker, using the information from the row of the change
  in order to send it to the associated topic (RegisteredModules/Module).

  This means that, if you register a module on the website with the 'Module' set as 'AnnoyingPeizo'. And write '4' to the
  'CurrentOutput' of the 'AnnoyingPeizo' row, the script will send to the topic: 
  
  'RegisteredModules/AnnoyingPeizo'

  The message: 
  
  '4'

  That message is sent to the ESP32 subscribed to that topic.

  that topic, is what needs to be put into the 'mqttTopic' const char* inside of sensitiveInformation.h, in order to associate
  the ESP32 with its respective database row within RegisteredModules.

  Example inside of sensitveInformation.h:

  const char* mqttTopic = "RegisteredModules/Servo";
  
  Additionally, its worth knowing: 
  
  The number in CurrentOutput is incrimented for each completion of the challenge, allowing for the ESP32 connected to
  that topic to activate. However, it is worth noting that strings can be put in the CurrentOutput, and be sent to the
  ESP32.
