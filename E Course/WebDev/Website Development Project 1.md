# Overview

The programming languages and technology focus in this unit will be:
- Docker Container
	- Server development
- Report Writing
- Spreadsheet
	- formulas

# Context

In this phase of the project, you will be learning about and configuring the server development environment. You will also be producing a report on the configuration and implementation of the server environment.

This project, comprised of two tasks, focuses on the creation and configuration of an individual server for you to deploy your websites to.

You will also produce a report, detailing the process and submitting a timesheet to your client as an invoice for your work.
