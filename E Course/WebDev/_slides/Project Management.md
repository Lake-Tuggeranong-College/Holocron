# Project Management in Software Development
notes:
Welcome everyone. Today we’re diving into key project management methodologies used in software development. We'll explore traditional and modern approaches, and how tools like Kanban and standups help teams stay productive and aligned.

# Waterfall Model
**Sequential development process**

---
# Waterfall Model

- **Example**: Government contract for a payroll system with fixed scope and timeline
- Pros:
  - Clear structure
  - Easy to manage
- Cons:
  - Inflexible to changes
  - Late testing phase

notes:
The Waterfall model is a linear, phase-based approach. Each stage must be completed before moving to the next. It's ideal for projects with fixed requirements, like government systems. However, it lacks flexibility, especially when changes arise late in the process.

# Agile Methodology (Scrum)
- **Iterative and incremental approach**
- Emphasizes:
  - Customer collaboration
  - Responding to change
  - Working software
- Common frameworks:
  - Scrum
  - XP (Extreme Programming)
  - SAFe (Scaled Agile Framework)
- **Example**: Startup building a mobile app with evolving user feedback

notes:
Agile is all about adaptability and collaboration. Scrum, one of the most popular Agile frameworks, breaks work into sprints. Teams deliver working software frequently and adjust based on feedback. This is perfect for startups or evolving products.

# Agile vs Waterfall
| Feature         | Waterfall       | Agile           |
|----------------|------------------|------------------|
| Structure       | Linear            | Iterative         |
| Flexibility     | Low               | High              |
| Testing         | Late phase        | Continuous        |
| Customer Input  | Limited           | Frequent          |
| Example         | Government system | Startup app       |

notes:
Let’s compare Agile and Waterfall. Agile is iterative and flexible, while Waterfall is structured and predictable. Agile suits dynamic environments; Waterfall works best when requirements are stable. Think about which fits your project context.

# Kanban Boards
- **Visual tool for workflow management**
- Key elements:
  - Columns: To Do, In Progress, Done
  - Cards: Represent tasks
- **Example**: DevOps team managing infrastructure tasks in Trello
- Benefits:
  - Transparency
  - Work-in-progress limits
  - Continuous delivery

**GitHub Projects** is another tool to create & use Kanban boards.

notes:
Kanban boards visualize work and help manage flow. Tasks move across columns like “To Do,” “In Progress,” and “Done.” This method supports continuous delivery and is great for teams handling support or operational work.

# Daily Standup Meetings
- **Short daily team meetings**
- Typical format:
  1. What did you do yesterday?
  2. What will you do today?
  3. Any blockers?
- **Example**: Scrum team using Zoom for remote standups at 9:00 AM daily
- Purpose:
  - Synchronize team
  - Identify issues early
  - Foster accountability

notes:
Standups are short, focused meetings held daily. Each team member shares progress, plans, and blockers. They keep everyone aligned and help surface issues early. Encourage brevity and consistency to make them effective.

---

# Logging of Jobs
- **Tracking work and progress**
- Tools:
  - Jira, Trello, Asana, GitHub Issues
- Best practices:
  - Clear descriptions
  - Time estimates
  - Status updates
- **Example**: Backend developer logs bug fixes and feature tasks in Jira
- Benefits:
  - Historical record
  - Performance tracking
  - Easier reporting

notes:
Logging tasks is essential for tracking progress and accountability. Tools like Jira or GitHub Issues help document work, estimate effort, and monitor status. This also supports reporting and retrospective analysis.

---

# Summary
- Choose methodology based on project needs  
- Agile promotes flexibility and collaboration  
- Kanban and standups improve visibility and communication  
- Logging ensures accountability and traceability

notes:
To wrap up: choose the right methodology for your project’s needs. Agile offers flexibility, Waterfall provides structure. Use Kanban and standups to improve visibility and communication. And always log work to maintain clarity and accountability.
