# Writing Technical Tutorials Using the ADDIE Model
### A guide for students developing PHP website projects

---

## What Is a Technical Tutorial?

- A step-by-step guide that teaches others how to build or use a technical project.
- Explains concepts, code, and processes clearly.
- Helps others learn by doing.

---

## Why Use the ADDIE Model?

- Provides a structured approach to tutorial writing.
- Ensures clarity, relevance, and effectiveness.
- Helps you think like an instructional designer.

---

## The ADDIE Model

1. **Analysis** – Understand your audience and goals.
2. **Design** – Plan the structure and flow.
3. **Development** – Write and build the tutorial.
4. **Implementation** – Share and publish.
5. **Evaluation** – Review and improve.

---

## A – Analysis

- Define your audience:
  - Example: "Beginner web developers with basic PHP knowledge."
- Identify learning goals:
  - Example: "Teach users how to build a login system using PHP and MySQL."
- List prerequisites:
  - Example: "Users should have XAMPP installed and know basic HTML."

---

## D – Design

- Outline tutorial sections:
  - Example:
    1. Introduction
    2. Environment setup
    3. Database creation
    4. PHP login script
    5. Testing
- Choose format:
  - Example: Markdown with screenshots and code blocks.
- Plan visuals:
  - Example: Diagram showing user authentication flow.

---

## D – Development

- Write content:
  - Example: "Create a file named `login.php` and add the following code..."
- Add visuals:
  - Example: Screenshot of the login form in the browser.
- Explain code:
  - Example: "This `mysqli_connect()` function connects to the database using the credentials provided."

---

## I – Implementation

- Publish tutorial:
  - Example: Upload to GitHub README or a blog platform.
- Make it accessible:
  - Example: Use headings, alt text for images, and readable fonts.
- Encourage feedback:
  - Example: "Leave a comment or open an issue if you find a bug or have questions."

---

## E – Evaluation

- Test the tutorial:
  - Example: Ask a peer to follow the tutorial and build the login system.
- Gather feedback:
  - Example: "Was any step unclear? Did the code work as expected?"
- Revise:
  - Example: Add missing steps or clarify confusing instructions.

---

## Final Tips

- Be consistent with formatting and terminology.
- Use real examples from your PHP project.
- Link to helpful resources (e.g., PHP.net).
- Keep improving your tutorial over time.
- **Create a glossary of common/technical terms**
