# Task

[[Task 4]]

You will create a Showcase video (ICTICT215 2.1) detailing how the project has met its goals and intentions. You will display the project being used and show the functionality with a voiced (recorded or AI generated) commentary that provides additional details. This will also involve giving or generating a narration that explains  how the project meets the needs of the user and/or the intentions of the project.

The goal of the showcase is to convey the project’s completed status to shareholders, investors, and consumers. This showcase would be the kind of thing to be shown to crowds at press conferences, IT conventions, gaming conventions etc.

The showcase should be 10 minutes (± 10%) in length.

Note: To be deemed competent, the video **must** be edited and include title and credit sequences (ICTICT215 2.1, 2.2), and background music and voice over (ICTICT215 2.3, 2.4)

Prior to the submission, seek feedback from your instructor on the draft showcase (ICTICT215 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3). Your final submission must be updated to incorporate the feedback provided. (ICTICT215 3.4).
