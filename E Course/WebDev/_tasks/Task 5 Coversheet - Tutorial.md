[[Task 5]]

You will create a tutorial that will teach future students how to complete an advanced part of your project. The intention is to publish this tutorial for future students to follow. (ICTICT216 1.1, 1.2, 1.3.)

Your tutorial must include (ICTICT216 2.1, 2.2, 2.3):

- A stated aim for what will be achieved by the end of the tutorial.
- What the reader will learn (educational goals)
- An explanation of the theoretical concepts that are involved in your tutorial (modularisation for example) and an analysis of why these concepts are important to the project as a whole.
- A step by step explanation of how to complete the tutorial and an analysis of how this addition will improve the project as a whole.

Prior to the final submission, seek feedback from your instructor on the draft tutorial (ICTICT216 3.1, 3.2.). Your final submission must be updated to incorporate the feedback provided.
