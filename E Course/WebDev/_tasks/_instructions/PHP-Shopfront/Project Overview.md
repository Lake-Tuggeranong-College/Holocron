# Shopping Cart Overview

The shopping cart functionality, or subsystem, is broken up into two pages - `orderForm.php` and `cart.php`. The Order form is responsible for displaying the products, allowing the user to select items to purchase. The Cart page displays the selected item/s and calculates the sub totals and total, and allows the user to ‘make’ a purchase.
