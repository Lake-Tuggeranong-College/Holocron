# Goal
Using your PC or laptop, or a school supplied one, install and configure
- a docker container for your future projects.
- PHP
- Visual Studio Code


# Requirements

For this task, you will require a PC/laptop (not a chromebook).

Once the docker container is deployed to the LTC Server, the remainder of the content can be developed and written on a Chromebook (through the use of GitHub's Codespaces)

# Instructions


## Project Configuration

## Open Project

Depending on your local development environment, you to open your project using one of the following methods:

1. Local Development: Open the repository folder using Visual Studio Code.
2. Online Development: Open the project in Codespaces from your GitHub repository in your browser.


### Local Development

> [!info] Use this option if you're developing on a PC/Mac/Linux machine.


Clone the repository to your computer using GitHub Desktop (or any method). Choose the newly created repository

Now, open **Github Desktop** on your computer and click "Clone Repository" under the File menu.

After a short moment, it will then show you this page:

Click on the Current Repository Download in the top left of the window. Right Click on the repository and choose to open it in the Visual Studio Code.


### Online Development

> [!info] Use this option if you're developing on a Chromebook.

Open your browser and go to your repository that was created earlier.

Click on the Code menu and choose **Create codespace on main**. This will open a new tab, and after some time, you will have an interface very similar to Visual Studio Code in the browser.

Note: The first time the codespace is opened, it can take some time to install. You may need to wait for a few minutes.
