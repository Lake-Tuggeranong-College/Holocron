# Goal
Using your PC or laptop, or a school supplied one, install and configure
- a docker container for your future projects.
- PHP
- Visual Studio Code


# Requirements

For this task, you will require a PC/laptop (not a chromebook).

Once the docker container is deployed to the LTC Server, the remainder of the content can be developed and written on a Chromebook (through the use of GitHub's Codespaces)

# Instructions

## Docker Desktop

If Docker isn't installed, install it here - https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/

After downloading the installer, install Docker Desktop and open it to confirm it installed correctly. Accept the service agreement (after reading the terms).

Use the recommended settings

Authenticate with Docker using your schools Google credentials.

## Visual Studio Code

Install from here
https://code.visualstudio.com/


# Docker Configuration



## `.devcontainer` file

This file configures the container so when it starts up, it automatically configures software to work for our project and environment.


In the repository folder, create a folder called `.devcontainer`. The folder starts with a `.` which may mean it is usually hidden in Windows Explorer/Finder etc.

Inside this folder, create a file called `devcontainer.json` and replace the contents with the following:

```json
// For format details, see https://aka.ms/devcontainer.json. For config options, see the
// README at: https://github.com/devcontainers/templates/tree/main/src/php
{
	"name": "PHP",
	// Or use a Dockerfile or Docker Compose file. More info: https://containers.dev/guide/dockerfile
	"image": "mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/php:1-8.2-bullseye",

	// Features to add to the dev container. More info: https://containers.dev/features.
	// "features": {},

	// Configure tool-specific properties.
	// "customizations": {},

	// Use 'forwardPorts' to make a list of ports inside the container available locally.
	// "forwardPorts": [
	// 	8080
	// ],
	"features": {
		"ghcr.io/warrenbuckley/codespace-features/sqlite:1": {},
		"ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/php:1": {}
	},
	// Use 'portsAttributes' to set default properties for specific forwarded ports. More info: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/devcontainerjson-reference.
	"portsAttributes": {
		"8000": {
			"label": "PHP Server",
			"onAutoForward": "notify"
		}
	},

	// Use 'postCreateCommand' to run commands after the container is created.
	"postCreateCommand": "bash .devcontainer/install-dependencies.sh",

	"postStartCommand": "php -S 0.0.0.0:8000"
	// Uncomment to connect as root instead. More info: https://aka.ms/dev-containers-non-root.
	// "remoteUser": "root"
}
```

## Install dependences file

In the same folder as the `devcontainder.json` file, create another file named `install-dependencies.sh`. Replace the contents with :

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install sqlite3
```

This file is referenced in `devcontainer.json` , excuting the script after the Docker container has been initialised for the first time.

After creating the two files, your project should appear like this:
