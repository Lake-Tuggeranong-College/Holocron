# Report

This report is your formal document to your client to explain and justify the choices made in the implementation of the server. In the report, you will need to explain to your client the reasoning for choosing a Docker container as the server, against the other options. (ICTICT214 2.1)

The report is to be written in Markdown using Markdown headers and styles (ICTICT214 2.2, 2.3).

## Server Technology Options

Research and briefly describe at least two alternative server hosting technologies (e.g., virtual machines, traditional bare-metal servers) that could have been used to host websites, providing a high-level overview of each.

Use diagrams, graphics, (ICTICT214 4.1, 4.2, 4.3) tables etc to describe the various approaches to server deployment. (ICTICT214 2.2)

## Docker Justification

Explain in detail why Docker was chosen for this project. Your explanation should incorporate key features of Docker as described in the course materials. 

Discuss the benefits of using Docker for managing and deploying web environments within the context of this course.

### Security Implications of Server Technologies

Research and discuss general security considerations and potential implications when setting up and managing server environments, particularly those involving containerisation like Docker.
# Invoice

Using the spreadsheet template provided (ICTICT214 3.1), create an invoice detailing the date, hours spent, and a brief description of the activity undertaken for each entry.

Using the Excel formulas, create formulas to calculate the (ICTICT214 3.2):
- subtotals for each individual line item (individual price * hours)
- subtotal for all items added together (sum of all subtotals)
- Calculate the GST (subtotal/11)
- The total cost of the invoice (subtotal + GST)

This spreadsheet needs to be saves in XLS and PDF format in the `task2` folder in your repository.
