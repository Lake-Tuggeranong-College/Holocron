> [!info] Raycasts are an invisible line between two points in game. Using Raycasts you can detect collisions (or potential collisions). They have a number of uses such as calculating the destination of a bullet, without creating (instantiating) a bullet in game, or if an object can ‘see’ another object (if there’s a wall in the way).

# Add Raycast

In the project, open the `Enemy.tscn` file to edit the enemy object. 

> [!important] This will update **all** enemy instances in the game, as the original scene is being modified.


Add a child node to the Enemy. Search for RayCast2D in the list and choose Create.

![[ISD/1 - Digital Assets/_project/Space Invaders/_images/raycastAddChild.png]]


With the new RayCast2D node selected, change the Inspector values `Target Position Y` to 200.

Attach a script to the RayCast2D node.

Replace the contents with the following code. This code will check if the ray is colliding with something, and if it is, then it sets the `can_shoot` (to be defined below) variable to true, otherwise it is false.

![[raycastScript.png]]

```gdscript
extends RayCast2D

# Called when the node enters the scene tree for the first time.

func _ready():
	set_process(true)

func _process(delta):
	if self.is_colliding():
		get_parent().can_shoot = false
	else:
		get_parent().can_shoot = true
```

Save the script.

# Enemy Script Update


Open `Enemy.gd` and create a new variable, declaring it at the top of the script.

```gdscript
var can_shoot = false
```

  
![[raycastEnemyVariable.png]]


**Update** the `fire_bullet()` function to first check if `can_shoot` is true. If it is true, then the normal ‘shooting’ code will execute.

Save the file.
