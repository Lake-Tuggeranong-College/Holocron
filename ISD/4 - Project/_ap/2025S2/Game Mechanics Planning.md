In preparation for the assessment task, you are to prepare and plan for future development. **The information you produce can be used in your first assessment task.**

You are to create a plan for the game mechanics you are planning to have in the final version of the game. 

Create a Google Doc, and start by categorising game mechanics into (at least) the following categories:
- Completed, 
- in active development,
- future development.

For each of the mechanics, indicate what the intended behaviour will be in the game. Be as specific as possible - imaging you are writing the logic to be used within a function but written in a human-readable format.

Include any specific variable value if it's been set already, or what you imagine it could be.

The end result could be similar to this:

| Mechanic        | Development Status | Intended behaviour                                                                                |
| --------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Player movement | Completed          | Player can move in any direction on the horizontal plane. No jumping is possible.<br>Speed = 100  |
| Player shooting | Completed          | Projectiles fire from the players POV towards the direction of the camera. <br>Bullet Speed = 300 |
| Multiplayer     | Active Development | 10 players maximum.                                                                               |
|                 |                    |                                                                                                   |
|                 |                    |                                                                                                   |
|                 |                    |                                                                                                   |
|                 |                    |                                                                                                   |
