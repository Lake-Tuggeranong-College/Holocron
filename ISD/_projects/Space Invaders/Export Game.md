Exporting a game out of Godot is highly beneficial for game developers as it enables them to distribute their games to a wider audience across multiple platforms. This increases the game's accessibility and potential player base.

Furthermore, exporting optimizes the game for specific platforms, ensuring smooth performance and enhanced visuals. It also allows developers to access platform-specific features and monetization options, increasing revenue potential. Additionally, exporting facilitates community involvement, cross-platform compatibility, and the long-term preservation of the game.

By exporting their games, developers can maximise their reach, improve gameplay quality, and increase their chances of success in the gaming industry.


Under Project menu, choose Export.

When you first add an OS, you may receive some errors. These need to be resolved before you can export.

Once the errors have been finalised, you will be able to select **Export Project**. This option compiles the project into a standalone executable for the OS you've selected.

> [!important] When exporting choose a folder **outside** of the project folder to avoid large files being added to your repository.
