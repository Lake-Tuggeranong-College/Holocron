# GDScript Implementation

Games can be written in many different Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) or game engines with many different languages. Unity and [Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/) are two of the most popular and use different languages between them - C#, Javascript, C++, Blueprints etc. Many of the Game engines available also allow for programming through visual scripting (similar to flowcharts) but will not be the focus of this course.

Games can be written in most languages, either in a game engine or not, however this semester youâ€™ll be learning Godot and GDscript to learn the fundamentals of game development in a beginner-friendly environment.

> [!info] Godot is the Game Engine, GDScript is the Language. Both of these will be used throughout this semester.

## Godot

[Godot](https://godotengine.org/) is a relatively new Game Engine/IDE, and is FOSS - Free and Open Source Software. It can be used for both 2D and 3D games.

## Game Development Process

The game development process is a complex one with many interconnected parts to it. Many developers will focus and specialise in one or two of these areas and collaborate with others to complete the entire process.

There is the coding, asset development, game testing, planning, sound engineering and many more.

# Practical Exercises

## Game Mechanics

Research Game Mechanics, what they are, and how they relate to Gameplay. 

Research Doom (1993) - identify the game mechanics included.

Choose 2 other games from different genres and list their game mechanics.

What makes a game fun to play?

What are some popular game genres?
