Read and practice all topics under [Mathematical & Logic Operations](https://www.notion.so/Mathematical-Logic-Operations-fbb6dd5a5acf434799d572e3e70a4e02?pvs=21).

# Practical Exercises

Using [https://circuitverse.org/](https://circuitverse.org/) draw the following Logic Circuits, and then complete the truth tables for each. You can use Google Sheets to create the truth tables if needed.

## Logic Circuits and Truth Tables

1. $(AB) + \overline{(AC)}$
2. ${\overline{AB} + {\overline{BC}}}$
3. ${\overline{\overline{AB} + {\overline{BC}}}}$
4. $A. \overline{B} + C\overline{(A.B)}$
5. $\overline{A}B\overline{C}$
6. $\overline{\overline{A}.\overline{B}} + C$

### For Example

$AB+C$

## Simplification

Simplify the following boolean equations. Show your working, and identity which rule you're using at each step.

1. $AA + B$
2. $C + \overline{BC}$

Complete the Karnaugh Map process for each of the following equations:

# Review

Discussion: Why is logic important when learning software development?

Discussion: What is the purpose of Karnaugh Maps and how does it assist us in developing solutions?
