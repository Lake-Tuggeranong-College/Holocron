# Smart Device Theme

Decide on a Device that you wish to automate. Some examples could be:

- Car
- Coffee Machine
- Mouse
- Computer Mouse
- Human
- etc

## Inputs and Output Components

For your device, you will need to use the following components (at a minimum). To clarify, you need to include ALL of the inputs and outputs listed. You also need to add at least one of the “Additional” sensors.

| Inputs (ALL required) | Outputs (ALL Required) | Additional (1 minimum) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Sonar / Distance | Traffic Light LEDs | Passive Infrared (PIR) |
| Line Sensor | Buzzer (Piezo) | Infrared Remote Control |
| Button (Crash) | DC Motor | GPS |
| Potentiometer | Servo | Bluetooth (need a MEGA) |
|  | SD Card Logging | RFID |

## Task

In a Google Doc, write the Introduction to your project, introducing the Smart Device you’re developing. Discuss *in general* the sensors you’re going to use and how they might be implemented. How they’ll fit together etc. 

The specifics will be defined later.

In your description:

- Identify each input and what it represents in your smart device.
- Identify each output and what it represents in your smart device.

Research to see if anything like your idea already exists, and include the details of the existing product into your theme.

> [!info] Keep It Simple. When defining the theme, start with :
> - one input only impacting one output
> - And conversely, one output being impacted by **one** input only.


## Examples

### Example 1 - Automated Car Space & Coffee System

For my automated system, I have decided to make an **automated car space** and office. The theory is that when the car enters the **car space** and the correct **GPS coordinates**, the **coffee machine** will turn on in the person’s office and brew them a cup of coffee. The **simulation** will be using a **crash sensor**, a **line sensor**, a **sonar**, a **GPS** and an **SD card**. The different **sensors** will activate **outputs** like two **motor fans**, a **buzzer** and an **LED**. To improve upon the system, I would make the code more **complex** so that there would need to be an **interaction** between the **inputs** for certain **outputs** to be activated.

### Example 2 - Automated Car

The theme of the project was meant to be an automatic car, some automatic cars look like this:

An automatic car, actually means “A car with automatic transmission”. Most cars these days are automatic because the market has increased over the past 20 years, and at the same time, the price of electronics has decreased.  Electronics in cars have become a common occurrence. There is an argument stating that the road is safer due to the abundance of automatic checks these cars have, from anti glare mirrors to automatic brakes, these little changes over the years have decreased the danger of the roads. There are even statements that self-driving cars are the future of the road, however that only seems to be the case if the only cars on the road are self-driving (CGP Gray, 2016).
