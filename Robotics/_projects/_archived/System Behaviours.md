## Instructions

Write the behaviours into your assessment Google Doc. This is the document you defined the Theme in.

## Define Behaviours

These are the descriptions of what should occur when the system is running, written in plain language. Keep them as simple as possible focusing on the formula:

When an Input occurs, perform an output, or to put it in more programming terms: `Input -> Processing -> Output`

> [!info]  Remember to write the behaviours in context - to line up with your theme!


## Sample Behaviour

When someone presses the dog collar (**button** is pressed), the dog barks (the buzzer is sounded).

## **Previous Examples**

**Here are a number of examples from previous years.**

## Sample Project

For the purposes for this tutorial, an example of a project theme and behaviours could be:

### Theme


The electronics board project will be prototyping a **Smart Home** of the future. The concept of this Smart Home is that everything will be either automated or controlled through various environmental monitoring.

Example Functionality:

The system will monitor the temperature and respond appropriately.

The users will be able to open and close blinds through different inputs.

### Behaviours

The expected behaviours of the system are:

1. When a person gets too close (**sonar**) to the house, an alarm is sounded (**piezo)**.
2. When the garage door button is pressed (**button**) the Door Opens (**servo**) and the red light is turned on (**Traffic Light Red LED**). There is a pause for 5 seconds, then the door is closed and the light turned off.
3. The fan (**DC Motor**) speed is controlled through the controller (**potentiometer**).
