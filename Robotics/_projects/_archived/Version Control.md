# Arduino Implementation

## TinkerCAD

TinkerCAD stores code in the browser, and does not have inbuilt version control. Therefore, you will need to commit and publish your code through Github.

## Electronics Board Project Development

When developing code for the Electronics Board project, you will start using the Arduino IDE and will then need to use a Version Control System to manage your code.

TinkerCAD and the Arduino IDE do not have in-built functionality for Version Control, unfortunately. This means that you need to use [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) to manage access to the git system. 

The information on this [Version Control System](https://www.notion.so/Version-Control-System-Github-527442170bf24bfba8cc3b4126d7493d?pvs=21) should aid you in configuring the environment.


> [!info] It is recommended that you start by creating a new repository in Github Desktop first. Then create individual sketches inside the repository folder for each project.


When appropriate (after moving away from TinkerCAD) create a new repository for the Electronics Board project.

After completing the tasks shown in the video, your repository should look similar to this one:

# Review

1. When do you push a project?
2. When do you pull a project?
3. Is Git a distributed or centralised system? Why?
4. How does Version Control assist in software development?
