# Servo Motor

Servos are more complicated motors than the standard DC motors. There are two types of servos - standard and continuous (or 360°).

In essence, a standard servo can turn to a particular angle that you give it. They can turn up to 180 degrees and you can write from -90 through to 0 and then through to 90 to the motor and it will jump to the exact angle you wish.

With a continuous servo, the value you write to it dictates the speed at which it turns.
