**What is code refactoring?**

Refactoring is making changes to the internal structure of code without changing its external behavior. This can make the code easier to read, understand, maintain, and extend.

Here are some examples of refactoring:

- Rename a variable to make its meaning clearer.
- Move a block of code to a separate method so that it can be reused.
- Split a large method into smaller methods so that it is easier to understand.
- Replace a complex expression with a simpler one.

Refactoring is a good practice to follow when you are developing code. It can help to improve the quality of your code and make it easier to work with in the future.

Here are some tips for refactoring code:

- Start small. Don't try to refactor too much code at once.
- Test your code after each change.
- Get feedback from other developers.

Refactoring is an ongoing process. As your code changes, you should periodically refactor it to keep it up to date.

To allow the project to scale up, and add functionality easily, it’s time to move the temperature and LED functionality into it’s own function and have the loop() call it.

To easily do this, rename the loop function to `temperatureAndLED()` and then create a new `loop()` that calls it.

Add a short delay into `loop()`. This will give the ESP32 a regular amount of time where it is idle, allowing new code to be uploaded to it.

<aside>
‼️ A rule of thumb is to always add a short delay in the loop function. Otherwise the Arduino/ESP may be too ‘busy’ to allow the IDE to upload new code.
