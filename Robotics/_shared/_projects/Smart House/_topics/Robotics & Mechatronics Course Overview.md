## Arduino Sketches

> [!info] Arduino Code is referred to as Sketches.


Each Arduino sketch needs to have the same basic structure.

**At a minimum**, the sketch needs to have the setup() and loop() functions.

# Practical Exercises

In this initial stage, you'll be using [TinkerCAD](https://www.tinkercad.com/) to virtually program Arduino Uno board.

Click on the first activity - “1 Blink”.

Choose `Circuit` from the `Create new design` menu.

Change the Basics components menu to Starters Arduino. Find `Blink` in that list.

![[overviewTinkerCADStartersMenu.png|overviewTinkerCADStartersMenu.png]]

Drag the Blink module to the editing area

![[overviewTinkerCADBlink.png|overviewTinkerCADBlink.png]]

Click on the Code button, and change the code type to Text.

Here you will see the "Hello World" code for Arduino, also referred to as Blink. At this stage, don't worry too much about the specific code - you'll learn that later. Just notice how the code is written, the syntax and the functions used - `setup()` and `loop()`.

You can start the code running by using the Start Simulation button.

You should see the LED flashing on and off every second.

Congratulations - you've (potentially) written your first Arduino Sketch!

## Extension

1. Goal: Update the code to flash on and off every half a second. 
	
	What part of the code would you need to change? 
	
2. Change the LED to be on pin 10. 
	
	What needs/needed to be changed?
	

## Review

1. How were the first computers programmed?
2. Where did the name "bug" originate?
3. What is this "Hello World" you speak of?
4. In plain language, What is the difference between interpreted and compiled code?
	1. Expand on your explanation by adding technical details.
5. What is the best programming language to learn? Why?
6. What does the term “Arduino” refer to?
7. How does the Arduino communicate between the computer and itself?
8. What do you use to display data sent from the Arduino?
9. What types of pins does an Arduino Uno have?
