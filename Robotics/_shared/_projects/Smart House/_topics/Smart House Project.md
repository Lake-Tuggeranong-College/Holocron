This project focuses on designing and simulating a smart house system using robotics principles within the Tinkercad environment. We will explore how various sensors, actuators, and microcontroller programming can be integrated to create an automated and intelligent living space


# TinkerCAD Project

Create a new project by opening the "Smart House" project in the class on TinkerCAD:

In this empty activity, add the Arduino Uno and a breadboard. Wire the power rails appropriately.

Before adding any sensors or actuators, or any additional components, and focus on the code design. The goal of this is to create code that is:
- clean
- organised
- self-documenting (to a point)
- simplified at the high-level (i.e. the `loop()` function only contains function calls to other functions).

# Code Design

Let's assume you've got 5 robotic behaviours that you wish to implement. For instance:
1) When the motion sensor detects movement in a room, the light bulb turns on. If no movement is detected for a specified period, the light bulb turns off to save energy.
2) When the temperature sensor detects that the room temperature has fallen below a set threshold, the smart thermostat activates the heater. Conversely, it activates the air conditioner if the temperature exceeds the threshold.
3) When the motion sensors detect movement and door/window sensors register unauthorized entry, the alarm system is triggered. Simultaneously, smart lights turn on in specific areas to deter intruders, and security cameras start recording. Door locks automatically engage to secure all entry points.
4) When the light sensor detects excessive sunlight, the motorised blinds lower automatically to reduce glare and heat. Conversely, they raise to allow more natural light when the sunlight is insufficient.
5) When the soil moisture sensor detects that the soil in the garden is too dry, the smart sprinkler system activates, watering the garden. It turns off automatically once the desired moisture level is achieved.

The code design should follow the features discussed in [[Robotics/_shared/_projects/Smart House/_topics/Algorithm Design - Modularisation|Modularisation]]. Therefore the high-level view of the code would appear to be something similar to this:

> [!note] In this flowchart you should be able to see that `loop()` has only got minimal amount of code in it, just calls to the other functions. 
> This allows the loop function to focus on the high-level logic (what order the functionality is in). 
> The low-level code is implemented in the specific functions. 
> This benefits the code to make it easier for the programmer to know where the code is located for each part of the project.
