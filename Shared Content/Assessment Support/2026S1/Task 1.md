**ASSESSMENT TASK 1 Project & Report**

# Assessment Context

>[!note] You are employed by Riker's Beard - a small, established software development company of 5 people. 
A co-worker has just gone on long service leave and you have taken over their project for the foreseeable future. You pull the project down from GitHub to find that it doesn’t run and has some errors in the code. Before you can start iterating on the project your manager requests that you fix the errors in your co-workers project and write a small report on the issue and how it was solved.

# Conditions

>[!danger] 2 working days before the assessment is due is the cutoff for:
>- Requesting extensions. Any legitimate reasons after this time are to be submitted to College Life.
>- Discussions regarding special consideration.
>- In class work ethic will be a factor when considering whether or not an extension is granted.
>- Formal Review and Feedback. 

# AI Summary

>[!important] In this task, you'll act as a developer fixing a broken project. You have 30 minutes to pull the code from GitHub, find the bugs, and fix them—make sure to document your process as you go. The remaining 90 minutes are for writing a technical report that explains the problem, shows evidence of your fix, and links the solution to a core theory concept.

# Description

In this assessment, you will be given a project, aligned with your in-class project, which is incorrectly configured. Your task is to investigate the issue/s, problem-solve, and fix the problem/s. After solving the issue/s, you are to write a report to explain the issue and the solution.

You will have a fixed time (double lesson) to pull a project down from GitHub and identify an issue with the project that is preventing it from completing a given task. Ensure that you know how to pull a project from GitHub to your device. You will be given the goal that the project is attempting to solve when the assessment starts. 

The issue/s with the project should be solvable in 30 minutes, leaving 90 minutes to finalise the report.  

In your report you will be required to relate the issue and solution back to a theoretical concept learnt in the early stages of the semester.  

This assessment will be conducted under exam conditions.

## Report

Using the template provided, explain and analyse:
- the issue with the provided (original) project,    
- the problem-solving steps you took to try and find the solution    
- how the specified focus is included in the solution and will be a beneficial focus for the project going forward.    

When writing your report:
- Write for the intended audience.     
- Use technical descriptions    
- Be concise and accurate    
- Use code and/or screenshots from the project as part of the report.
