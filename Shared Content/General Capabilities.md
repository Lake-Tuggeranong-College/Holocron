# Navigating Your Future: General Capabilities in the ACT Senior Secondary System

As you enter Years 11 and 12 in the ACT, your education is about more than just passing exams and memorising facts. The **ACT Board of Senior Secondary Studies (BSSS)** curriculum is designed to equip you with a set of "General Capabilities."
These are the transferable skills, behaviours, and dispositions that will help you succeed not just in your ATAR or vocational certificate, but in university, the workforce, and life.

## The 7 Core Capabilities

Every course you study—whether it is a Tertiary (T), Accredited (A), or Vocational (V) course—integrates these seven pillars:

1. **Literacy:** Beyond just English class, this is your ability to interpret and create texts across all subjects, from writing lab reports in IT to analysing sources in History.
2. **Numeracy:** The capacity to use mathematics confidently in everyday life. This could include interpreting data in Psychology or managing measurements in Design and Technology.
3. **Digital Literacy:** Moving beyond basic computer use to being a discerning user of technology, managing data, and staying safe and ethical in digital spaces.
4. **Critical and Creative Thinking:** The ability to generate and evaluate knowledge, clarify concepts, and examine different perspectives to solve complex problems.
5. **Personal and Social Capability:** Developing self-awareness and self-management. This is vital for the independent study and group work required in college.
6. **Ethical Understanding:** Learning to build a strong personal and socially oriented ethical outlook that helps you manage conflict and social pressure.
7. **Intercultural Understanding:** Developing a deeper appreciation of your own and others' cultures and languages, which is essential in our globalised world.

## Detailed Framework: Elements and Sub-elements

To better understand how you are assessed, here is the breakdown of the specific skills within each capability, organised by their core elements:

## Why These Matter

### 1. Future-Proofing Your Career (The Primary Advantage)

The most significant reason to focus on these capabilities is that employers and universities are increasingly prioritising "soft skills" over raw scores. By the time you receive your **ACT Senior Secondary Certificate**, you won't just have a list of grades; you will have a documented history of developing the "General Capabilities" that make you a versatile, adaptable, and highly capable adult in an ever-changing job market.
