Boilerplate code refers to sections of code that are **repeated in many places with little or no variation**. It's often used to set up the basic structure of a program or application, such as initializing libraries, defining classes, or configuring settings. While necessary, boilerplate code usually doesn't contain the core logic of the program—it's more about setup and consistency.
