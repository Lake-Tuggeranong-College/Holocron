# Definition

The bottom-up approach to software development starts with the implementation of individual modules and gradually combines them to build the complete system. It focuses on creating reusable, independent components that can be assembled to meet the system requirements.

**Steps:**

1. Design and implement individual modules or components.
2. Test the modules independently.
3. Integrate the modules into larger subsystems.
4. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until the complete system is built.

See [[Top Down Approach]]

# Example/s

Building a word processor using reusable components:

- **Bottom level:** Create components for basic functionality, such as text input, formatting, and printing.
- **Integration:** Combine the components into modules, such as a text editor module and a document printing module.
- **Final system:** Integrate the modules to build the complete word processor.
