# Definition

In software development, a constant is a named value that cannot be changed during the execution of a program. Constants are used to store values that are known at compile time and that should not change during the execution of a program.

Constants can be of any data type, including numbers, strings, booleans, and arrays. Constants can also be used to store references to other objects.

Constants are an important part of software development. They allow programmers to define values that cannot be changed during the execution of a program. Constants can also be used to improve the readability and maintainability of code.

Here are some examples of how constants are used in software development:

- A program that calculates the area of a circle might use a constant to store the value of π.
- A program that manages a user's account might use a constant to store the maximum number of failed login attempts allowed.
- A program that plays a game might use a constant to store the number of lives that the player has.
