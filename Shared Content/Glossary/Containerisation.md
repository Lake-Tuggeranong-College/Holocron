Containerisation is a way of packaging and running applications on a computer. It's like a digital box that holds everything you need to run an app, including the code, libraries, and settings.

Think of it like a suitcase: just as your clothes, toiletries, and documents are packed into a suitcase so you can take them with you on a trip, a containerisation "suitcase" holds all the bits and bobs needed to run an application. This means that no matter where you're running the app from (like your home computer or a server in a data centre), it'll work exactly the same way.

Containerisation is different from virtualisation because it's not creating a separate computer for each app. Instead, it's just giving each app its own little space to run in, without needing to set up an entire operating system. This makes it faster and more efficient than virtualisation, as you don't need to use up all the resources on your machine.

Containerisation is used by many companies and developers because it's a great way to make sure that applications work together smoothly, and that changes can be made quickly without affecting other apps on the same system. It's like having multiple suitcases in one place, each with its own contents – you can pick up any suitcase (app) you need and start working on it straight away.
