# Definition

The NAND logic gate, also known as the NOT-AND gate or Sheffer stroke, is a digital logic gate that performs the logical NAND operation. It has two or more inputs and one output. The NAND operation is defined as the negation of the AND operation, meaning that the output of a NAND gate is false if and only if all of its inputs are true.

**Function:**

The NAND gate outputs the opposite of the AND operation:

- If all inputs are **1**, the output is **0**.
- Otherwise, the output is **1**.

**Truth Table:**

|Input A|Input B|Output (A NAND B)|
|---|---|---|
|0|0|1|
|0|1|1|
|1|0|1|
|1|1|0|
