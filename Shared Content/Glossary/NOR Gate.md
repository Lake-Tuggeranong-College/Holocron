# Definition

The NOR logic gate is a digital logic gate that performs the logical NOR operation. It has two or more inputs and one output. The NOR operation is defined as the negation of the OR operation, meaning that the output of a NOR gate is only true if all of its inputs are false.

**Function:**

The NOR gate outputs the opposite of the OR operation:

- If any input is **1**, the output is **0**.
- If all inputs are **0**, the output is **1**.

**Truth Table:**

|Input A|Input B|Output (A NOR B)|
|---|---|---|
|0|0|1|
|0|1|0|
|1|0|0|
|1|1|0|
