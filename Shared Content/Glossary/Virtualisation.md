Virtualisation is when you can run multiple computers on one machine. Just like how you have different files and folders on your computer, virtualisation lets you create separate "virtual" computers that can run their own operating systems.

Think of it like having a big box of different boxes inside the main box. Each smaller box (or virtual computer) has its own operating system, like Windows or Mac OS, and runs its own programs. This means you can have multiple things running at the same time on one machine, without using up all the space or resources.

Virtualisation is used in many places, like data centres where companies store their information, and even in some homes and schools to help with computing tasks. It's a way to make better use of technology and have more flexibility when working with computers.
