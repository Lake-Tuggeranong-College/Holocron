> [!info] PHP sessions are a way for a website to remember information about a user as they interact with the website.

PHP sessions are a way for a web server to store and maintain information about a user's interaction with a website across multiple requests. Sessions are used to store user-specific data, such as login credentials, shopping cart contents, or user preferences, so that this data can be accessed by the server on subsequent requests.

When a user visits a website, the server generates a unique session ID and sends it to the client's browser in the form of a cookie or as part of the URL. The browser sends this session ID back to the server with each subsequent request, allowing the server to identify the user and retrieve their session data.

PHP provides a built-in session handling mechanism that makes it easy to create and manage sessions in web applications. The **`session_start()`** function is used to start a new session or resume an existing one, and the **`$_SESSION`** superglobal array is used to store and retrieve session data.

Here's a basic example of how sessions can be used in PHP:

```php
// start or resume a session
session_start();

// store data in the session
$_SESSION['username'] = 'johndoe';
$_SESSION['cart'] = array('item1', 'item2', 'item3');

// retrieve data from the session
$username = $_SESSION['username'];
$cart = $_SESSION['cart'];
```

In this example, we start a new session using **`session_start()`**, and then store some data (a username and a shopping cart) in the **`$_SESSION`** array. On subsequent requests, we can retrieve this data from the **`$_SESSION`** array and use it as needed.

It's important to note that sessions are not a secure way to store sensitive data such as passwords or credit card numbers. Session data can be easily tampered with or stolen, so it's important to use encryption and other security measures to protect sensitive information.
