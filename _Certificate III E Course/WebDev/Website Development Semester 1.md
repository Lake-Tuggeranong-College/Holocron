# Overview

The focus of this semester is to learn and develop the architecture and infrastructure required for the remainder of the projects in subsequent projects.

This includes learning about Virtualisation and Docker Containers, and how they benefit application development.

You will also be producing a report on the configuration and implementation of the server environment. Included in this report will be a timesheet detailing the process to your client as an invoice for your work.

# Schedule

Classes will run on Tuesday's each week during TRaC-X and lunchtime as workshops, or 'drop-in' class.
Classes on Thursday's (2-4pm) will cover the topics below. Assessments are due on the Thursday of the week indicated.

- Define the services.
- Properly configure network connectivity between the website and the database containers.
- Use volumes to ensure data persistence for the database.
- Set necessary environment variables (e.g., database credentials).
