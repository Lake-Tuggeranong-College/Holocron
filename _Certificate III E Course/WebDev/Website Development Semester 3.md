## Task 3.3- Team-based Development

### Task Overview

In this task you will work in a small team to collaboratively develop a PHP website. In your group you will work in a formal project management structure, where you will communicate through Kanban boards, and stand up meetings. 

You will need to determine the requirements of the project, make decisions based on these requirements and user requirements, and implement them quickly and effectively.

You will also need to meet (face-to-face and/or virtually) as required to make group-decisions and meet project goals and deadlines.

> [!important] While the website developed for this project is a group task, you will be assessed **individually**. Read the Assessment Task for details. 
>  It is therefore important that you are all active members of the development team, including the development of the website code, as well as the project management techniques.
