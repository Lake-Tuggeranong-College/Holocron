| Operating System | Key Characteristics              | Use Case / Benefit                                                 |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Linux**        | Open-source, highly customizable | Reliable for server environments; low licensing costs              |
| **macOS**        | Proprietary to Apple hardware    | Focused on multimedia and creative professional workflows          |
| **Windows**      | Global enterprise standard       | Extensive support for business tools (Active Directory, BitLocker) |

|Software Category|Description|Primary Use Case|
|---|---|---|
|**Multimedia & Design**|Creative tools for visual and audio content|Necessary for video editing and 3D rendering|
|**DBMS**|Database Management Systems|Required for complex, multi-user relational data|
|**Productivity Suites**|Office and administrative applications|Standard for office tasks (spreadsheets, word processing)|

## Organisational Requirements

|Requirement|Description|Business Benefit|
|---|---|---|
|**Data Reliability**|Use of RAID configurations|Minimizes system downtime and prevents data loss|
|**Scalability**|Ensuring storage and processing capacity|Handles high-volume data transfers as the company grows|
|**Connectivity**|Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) support|Enables secure remote access to centralized computing power|

- The "Brain" of the computer.
- Responsible for executing program instructions and logical operations.
- **Thermal Management:** Requires a Heat Sink and Fan to dissipate energy.

- **RAM (Random Access Memory):** Volatile memory (lost on power-off) for active processes.
- **SSD (Solid State Drive):** Non-volatile permanent storage. Connected via **SATA** or **NVMe**.

--
## Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)

- Essential for graphic design and 3D modeling.
- Connected to monitors via **HDMI** or **DisplayPort** cables.

--
## Internal Support: The PSU

- **Power Supply Unit (PSU):** Converts AC wall power to DC and regulates it for internal drives.

|Category|Peripheral Device|Function / Purpose|
|---|---|---|
|**Input**|Keyboard & Mouse|Primary control and data entry via typing and cursor movement|
|**Input**|Scanner & Microphone|Converting physical documents or audio signals into digital data|
|**Output**|Monitor|Visual interface used to display output from the GPU|
|**Output**|Printer|Generates physical "hard copies" of digital documents|
|**Output**|Speakers|Converts electrical signals into audible sound|

# Summary & Review

- **OS Selection:** Balance cost vs. reliability.
- **Hardware Matching:** Align components (like GPUs) with specific user needs (like Art/Design).
- **Memory Management:** Know the difference between Volatile (RAM) and Non-Volatile (Storage).
