# What is Personal Identifiable Information

> Your personally identifiable information is any piece of information, or ‘data’, that can help to confirm who you are or how to find you. It may be information used on its own or in context with other information.

## Identifying and Classifying Personal Information

Understanding how Australian law protects your personal details is crucial in our digital world. In Australia, the key piece of legislation is the **Privacy Act 1988**, which uses the term **'personal information'** (similar to what is often called PII, or Personally Identifiable Information).

### Step 1: Defining 'Personal Information'

The Australian Privacy Act defines **Personal Information** as:

> "Information or an opinion about an identified individual, or an individual who is **reasonably identifiable**, whether the information or opinion is true or not, and whether the information or opinion is recorded in a material form or not."

- **Identified Individual:** This is straightforward. If the information names you directly, it's personal information.
- **Reasonably Identifiable:** This is the key. Can a person or organisation work out who you are from the information, or by combining it with other information they have access to? If the answer is yes, it's personal information.

#### 💡 Examples of Personal Information

|**Category**|**Examples**|
|---|---|
|**Direct Identifiers**|**Name**, **Signature**, **Photograph**, Driver's License/Passport number, Student ID|
|**Contact Details**|Home address, personal email address, personal phone number|
|**Financial/Official**|Bank account details, Medicare card number, Tax File Number (TFN)|
|**Other Data**|Date of birth/Age, Medical records, Employment details, an opinion about you|

> **Context Matters:** A piece of information alone might not identify you (like a birth year), but when combined with a postcode and gender, you might become "reasonably identifiable." Always be cautious!

### Step 2: Classifying Personal Information into Categories

The Australian Privacy Act separates personal information into two main categories, with the second one having much stronger legal protections.

#### 1. General Personal Information

This is the broad category covering most of the examples listed above. It is protected by the Australian Privacy Principles (APPs). Organisations must manage this information transparently and securely, only collect what is necessary, and generally must not use or disclose it for a purpose other than why it was collected (unless an exception applies, like getting your consent).

#### 2. Sensitive Information (The Higher Protection Category)

**Sensitive Information** is a subset of personal information that is considered particularly private, and its misuse could lead to discrimination or other harm. For this reason, the law places **higher standards** on how it is collected and handled. Generally, it requires your explicit consent to be collected.

Sensitive information includes information or an opinion about an individual's:
- **Racial or ethnic origin**
- **Political opinions or associations**
- **Religious beliefs or affiliations**
- **Philosophical beliefs**
- **Sexual orientation or practices**
- **Criminal record**
- **Membership** of a trade union or professional/trade association
- **Health information** (e.g., medical records, mental health status)
- **Genetic information**
- **Biometric information** used for verification (e.g., fingerprints, facial recognition data)

|**Category**|**Protection Level**|**Key Requirement**|
|---|---|---|
|**General Personal Information**|Standard|Must be managed according to the 13 Australian Privacy Principles (APPs).|
|**Sensitive Information**|**Stronger**|Generally requires **express consent** for collection and has stricter rules for use and disclosure.|

### Step 3: Practising Identification and Classification

When encountering data, ask yourself these three questions:

1. **Is this information about an individual?** (e.g., a person, not a company).
2. **Does it, on its own or with other available information, identify the individual or make them reasonably identifiable?**
    - _If Yes $\rightarrow$ It is **Personal Information**._
3. **Does the information fall into one of the specific categories listed under Sensitive Information?**
    - _If Yes $\rightarrow$ It is **Sensitive Information** and needs the highest protection._
    - _If No $\rightarrow$ It is **General Personal Information**._

Understanding the difference is key to knowing what level of care and consent is required when sharing, collecting, or storing data.

### Step 4: Securely Storing and Sharing Personal and Workplace Information

When you handle personal information (PII) or confidential workplace data, you become a guardian of that information. Your organisation (like a school, employer, or club) has legal obligations, and you are responsible for helping meet them.

#### 🔒 Data Security and Access Control Protocols

Security means preventing unauthorised access. Access Control is the method used to manage **who** can view or use the data.

- **Encryption:** Store sensitive data in an encrypted format. Think of encryption as scrambling the data so only people with the right **key** (a password or decryption software) can read it.
- **Strong Passwords & Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Use long, unique, and complex passwords. Always use **MFA** (like a code sent to your phone) for accounts that hold PII. This is an essential layer of defence.
- **Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP):** Only grant access to the minimum amount of data required for a person to do their job. For example, a student club Treasurer needs access to membership fees, but not necessarily members' health records (unless required for a specific purpose).
- **Secure Sharing Platforms:** Avoid sending PII via unencrypted personal email. Use secure, approved channels like encrypted file-sharing services, secure network drives, or school/work-approved document systems.

#### ✅ Maintaining Accuracy and Currency

Organisations must take reasonable steps to ensure the personal information they hold is **accurate, up-to-date, and complete**.

- **Regular Confirmation:** If your workplace holds personal details, you should be asked to confirm or update them periodically (e.g., every school year or work quarter).
- **Correction Requests:** Under Australian privacy law, you have the right to request an organisation to **correct** your personal information if you believe it is wrong. If you handle records, always verify an individual's request to update their data and make the change promptly.
- **Delete/Destroy Old Data:** Once PII is no longer needed for a legal or operational purpose, it must be securely **deleted or destroyed**. Storing old, irrelevant PII is a risk.

### Step 5: Applying Advanced Protection Protocols and Compliance

Organisations must go beyond basic security to actively manage and mitigate privacy risks and ensure continuous adherence to the law.

#### 🛡️ Data Backup Strategies

Backups are critical for **data availability**—ensuring the information can be recovered after a system failure, ransomware attack, or physical disaster. The Australian Privacy Principles (APPs) require entities to protect personal information from loss.

- **On-Site Backups (Local):** Copies of data are stored on physical media (like hard drives or servers) located within the same building or network. This allows for **fast recovery** but is vulnerable to physical disaster at that location.
- **Off-Site Backups (Remote/Cloud):** Copies of data are stored in a physically separate location, often in a secure commercial data centre or the **cloud**. This protects data from local disasters (fire, flood) and is crucial for meeting disaster recovery requirements. **Always ensure off-site data storage adheres to Australian data protection standards (or those of a comparable jurisdiction like the EU's GDPR).**

#### 🔍 Privacy Impact Assessments (PIAs)

A **PIA** is a formal process that helps an organisation systematically identify and evaluate the privacy risks associated with a **new project, system, or product** that involves the collection, use, or disclosure of personal information.

- **Purpose:** To confirm compliance with the APPs and other privacy legislation **before** the project launches.
- **Action:** If you are part of a project (e.g., developing a new student app or collecting medical records for a sports carnival), a PIA would prompt questions like: Is this data absolutely necessary? How will we secure it? How long will we keep it?

#### ✅ Confirming Data Protection Compliance

Organisations must consistently monitor their practices to confirm they adhere to privacy laws.

- **Audits and Reviews:** Regularly scheduled internal or external audits check if security measures, access controls, and data handling practices still meet the organisation's privacy policy and the **Australian Privacy Principles (APPs)**.
- **Training:** All staff and volunteers who handle PII must receive regular training on privacy policies, the difference between general and sensitive information, and breach reporting procedures.
- **Supplier Due Diligence:** If your organisation shares PII with a third party (e.g., a cloud service provider or a mailing house), your organisation must confirm that the supplier also meets Australian data protection compliance standards. This is critical for meeting **APP 8 (Cross-border Disclosure)** requirements if the data goes overseas.

### Step 6: Understanding and Reporting Data Breaches (The NDB Scheme)

A **data breach** occurs when personal information held by an organisation is **lost, accessed, or disclosed** without authorisation. Australia's **Notifiable Data Breaches (NDB) Scheme** (Part IIIC of the Privacy Act 1988) mandates what organisations must do when a serious breach occurs.

#### What is an 'Eligible Data Breach'?

The NDB scheme applies only to an **'eligible data breach'**. This occurs if three conditions are met:

1. **Unauthorised Access, Disclosure, or Loss:** Personal information held by an entity is subject to unauthorised access, disclosure, or is lost.
2. **Likely to Result in Serious Harm:** This breach is likely to result in **serious harm** to one or more individuals. _Serious harm_ can include identity theft, significant financial loss, threats to physical safety, or serious emotional distress.
3. **No Prevention:** The entity has not been able to prevent the likely risk of serious harm through immediate action (remedial action).

#### 🚨 How to Report and Respond

If you discover or suspect a breach, your organisation has a legal clock ticking:

1. **Stop the Leak (Containment):** Your immediate responsibility is to stop the unauthorised access or loss. This might mean disabling an account, recalling an email, or taking a device offline.
2. **Notify Your Supervisor/Privacy Officer:** **Report the incident immediately** to your manager or the designated Privacy Officer/IT Security team. They must assess the breach within **30 days** to determine if it is "eligible."
3. **Mandatory Notification (If Eligible):** If the breach is deemed "eligible," the organisation has a legal obligation to notify two parties **as soon as practicable**:
    - **Affected Individuals:** The organisation must alert every individual at risk of serious harm, explaining:
        - What happened.
        - What types of information were involved.
        - **Recommendations** on steps they should take to protect themselves (e.g., changing passwords).
    - **The Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC):** A formal statement must be submitted to the OAIC.
4. **Document Everything:** Keep a detailed record of the incident, the personal information involved, the remedial action taken, and all notifications made.

> **Why Notification Matters:** The NDB scheme is designed to give affected individuals the earliest possible chance to take action to protect themselves from serious harm, such as freezing bank accounts or changing passwords.
