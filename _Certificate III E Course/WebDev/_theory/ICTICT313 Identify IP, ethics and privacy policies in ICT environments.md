This tutorial explains the key principles behind **organisational** policies on **Intellectual Property (IP)**, **Ethics**, and **Privacy**, and how you fit into those rules.

# Identify Principles Underpinning Organisational IP, Ethics and Privacy Policy Procedures

## What are these policies and why do they exist?

Organisations (like your school, an employer, or a company) create these policies to protect their assets, reputation, and stakeholders (employees, customers, etc.).

| **Policy Type**                | **Core Principle**            | **Why It Matters (The Goal)**                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Intellectual Property (IP)** | **Ownership**                 | To protect the **original creations** of the organisation (ideas, designs, software, brand names) from being copied or used without permission. |
| **Ethics**                     | **Integrity & Fairness**      | To ensure all **organisational** actions are honest, transparent, and do not cause harm to people or the environment.                           |
| **Privacy**                    | **Confidentiality & Consent** | To protect the **personal information** of individuals (customers, employees) from unauthorised access, collection, or sharing.                 |

# Identify Own Role in Observing and Adhering

You are a direct representative of the **organisation**, and your actions matter. Your primary role is to **OBSERVE** and **ADHERE** to the policies to avoid **infringement** (breaking the rules).

| **Policy Area** | **Your Role & Action Items**                                                                                                                                                                                     | **Consequences of Infringement**                                                                                   |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **IP**          | **Don't Copy/Share:** You must not copy code, designs, presentations, or client lists and share them outside the organisation, or use them in a personal project.                                                | **Theft of IP:** This can lead to serious legal action and termination of your relationship with the organisation. |
| **Privacy**     | **Don't Snoop/Leak:** You must only access information you need for your specific task. Never share a colleague's or customer's personal data (phone number, address, health info) with anyone else.             | **Breach of Confidentiality:** Damages trust and can result in large government fines for the organisation.        |
| **Ethics**      | **Be Honest/Report:** You must always be truthful in your work and reporting. If you see someone breaking the rules (like stealing office supplies or lying to a client), you have an ethical duty to report it. | **Reputation Damage:** The organisation's reputation and your own career prospects can be severely harmed.         |

## Case Study Example: IP Infringement

- **Scenario:** You are an intern at a game development studio. You spend the summer coding a unique animation engine for the company's new game. When you leave, you take a copy of the engine's source code, planning to use it in your own personal project.
- **Infringement:** This is a clear **IP infringement**. The work you created on their time and using their resources (the code) belongs to the studio.
- **Result:** The studio could sue you for copyright infringement and theft of trade secrets. Your role was to leave all company work on company systems.

# Determine the Purpose and Intention of Policies

Understanding the **why** helps you make better decisions when the policy isn't perfectly clear. The intention is always about **Risk Management** and **Trust**.

## Case Study Example: Privacy Policy Intention

- **Scenario:** You work part-time at a local bookshop and have access to the customer loyalty database (names, phone numbers, favourite genres). Your friend asks you for the phone number of a cute customer she met once.
- **Intention Check:** The **Privacy Policy** exists to **Build Customer Trust**. If the bookshop allowed employees to share customer data for personal reasons, customers would stop shopping there.
- **Your Action:** You must refuse to share the information. The intent of the policy is to keep that data strictly confidential.

# Identify and Understand Different Ethical Theories and Approaches

Ethics isn't just about what feels right; philosophers have developed specific frameworks to help us make tough choices.

## A. Utilitarianism (Consequences-Based)

- **Core Idea:** The most ethical choice is the one that results in the **greatest good for the greatest number** of people.
- **Focus:** The **outcome** or **consequences** of the action.

## B. Deontology (Duty-Based)

- **Core Idea:** Ethics is about following a clear set of **duties, rules, and principles**, regardless of the outcome.
- **Focus:** The **act itself** and whether it fulfills a moral obligation.

# Understand and Apply Principles Underpinning Organisational IP, Ethics and Privacy Policy Procedures

This section clarifies why these policies are _developed_ and details the **core principles** that guide their creation.

## Identify the Purpose in Developing and Implementing Procedures

Policies are not just long documents; they are **procedural blueprints** designed to make the general principles (Ownership, Integrity, Confidentiality) actionable and measurable.

The main purpose of developing and implementing these procedures is to **prevent infringement and harm** by creating clear, repeatable steps.

| **Policy Area**                      | **Purpose of Procedures/Guidelines**                                                                                     | **Example Procedure**                                                                                                                            |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **IP (To prevent IP infringement)**  | **Documentation & Assignment:** To legally prove that the IP created by an employee belongs to the organisation.         | Every new employee must sign an **IP Assignment Agreement** before starting work.                                                                |
| **Ethics (To ensure integrity)**     | **Transparency & Accountability:** To create a safe way for employees to report wrongdoing without fear of retaliation.  | Establishing a **Whistleblower Hotline** (an anonymous reporting system) or a formal **Code of Conduct**.                                        |
| **Privacy (To prevent data breach)** | **Access Control & Destruction:** To limit who sees personal data and ensure that data is deleted when no longer needed. | Requiring **two-factor authentication** to access the customer database, or requiring old paper files to be **shredded** (not just thrown away). |


## Determine the Principles Applied in the Organisational Policies

The procedures and rules outlined in the policies are built upon specific foundational principles. Recognising these principles helps you understand the policy's intent.

### A. IP Principles (Focus on Ownership)

1. **Work-for-Hire Doctrine:** Any creative work or invention developed by an employee within the scope of their job duty automatically belongs to the employer. This is the main principle preventing employee IP infringement.
2. **Non-Disclosure (Confidentiality):** Principles requiring employees to keep "trade secrets" (like unique formulas, unreleased designs, or marketing plans) private, protecting the company's competitive edge.

### B. Ethics Principles (Focus on Integrity)

1. **Fiduciary Duty:** The principle that an employee or director must act in the best financial and legal interest of the organisation, not their own personal interest.
2. **Non-Discrimination:** Principles requiring fair treatment for all individuals, regardless of characteristics like age, gender, or religion.
3. **Conflict of Interest:** Principles ensuring that an employee's personal interests (like owning stock in a supplier) do not interfere with or improperly influence their **organisational** duties.

### C. Privacy Principles (Focus on Data Protection)

1. **Data Minimisation:** The principle that an organisation should only collect the minimum amount of personal data necessary for a specific purpose.
2. **Purpose Limitation:** The principle that data collected for one purpose (e.g., shipping an order) cannot be used for a separate, unrelated purpose (e.g., selling that data to a third-party marketer) without new consent.
3. **Security:** The principle that data must be protected using technical measures (encryption, firewalls) and physical measures (locked filing cabinets).

# Assist with Non-Compliance Incident Identification and Recommendations

This section focuses on the proactive steps organisations take to prevent problems (risk assessment) and how employees assist in identifying and resolving issues when policies are broken (non-compliance).

## Identify Organisational Risk Assessment and Identification Process

Organisations do not wait for incidents to happen; they use a **Risk Assessment** process to systematically identify vulnerabilities and threats to their IP, ethical reputation, and data privacy.

The goal is to determine the **Likelihood** of an incident and the potential **Impact** (financial, legal, reputation).

The general process involves four stages:

1. **Identify:** Locate all assets (customer data, source code, brand name) and potential threats (hackers, negligent employees, natural disasters).
2. **Analyse:** Determine the likelihood and potential impact of each threat occurring.
3. **Evaluate:** Rank the risks from highest to lowest severity to decide which need immediate attention.
4. **Treat (Mitigate):** Implement controls (procedures, security software, training) to reduce or eliminate the risk.

## Assist with Identifying and Observing Non-Compliance Infringements

Your role is to be observant and report anything that looks like a policy violation, whether it's an internal mistake or an external attack.

| **Policy Area** | **Type of Infringement** | **Red Flags to Observe (Examples)**                                                                                                           |
| --------------- | ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **IP**          | **External Theft**       | Finding a competitor using a logo very similar to the organisation's, or seeing company proprietary documents being shared on a public forum. |
| **Privacy**     | **Internal Snooping**    | Noticing a coworker accessing customer records that have nothing to do with their job (e.g., looking up their neighbour's address).           |
| **Ethics**      | **Financial Misconduct** | Observing a manager consistently falsifying expense reports or accepting large, undisclosed gifts from a supplier.                            |

### Case Study Example: Non-Compliance Identification

- **Scenario:** You are updating the company website and notice a watermark on an image that says "Stock Photo Inc." The organisation's IP policy requires all images to be paid for and licensed. You check the internal licensing database and find no record of payment for that image.
- **Non-Compliance:** This is an **external IP infringement** (copyright violation) that the company is _committing_.
- **Your Action:** You must immediately report this to your supervisor or the legal department. Ignoring it would mean you are participating in the non-compliance, exposing the organisation to a lawsuit from the stock photo company.

## Identify Principles that Could Assist with Overcoming Non-Compliance Incidents with Relevant Personnel

Once a non-compliance incident is identified, the goal shifts to containment and resolution. Several key principles guide this response:

1. **Containment and Remediation:** The immediate principle is to stop the damage and fix the system. _Example: If a data breach is found, shut down the affected server immediately (Containment), then patch the security hole (Remediation)._
2. **Accountability:** This principle ensures that the people responsible for the breach (whether due to negligence or malice) are identified and held responsible according to the ethics/HR policy.
3. **Transparency (Internal and External):** Organisations must decide what information to share. Internally, employees need to know how to avoid the mistake. Externally, customers and regulatory bodies must be informed about privacy breaches (often legally required).
4. **Involving Relevant Personnel:** Non-compliance is rarely a single person's problem. Resolution requires a team:
    - **IT/Security:** For technical containment and repair (e.g., data breaches).
    - **Legal Counsel:** For assessing legal risk, contacting regulators, and issuing cease-and-desist letters (e.g., IP infringement).
    - **Human Resources (HR):** For enforcing disciplinary action against internal non-compliance (e.g., ethical misconduct).

# Quick Recap: Your IP/Ethics/Privacy Checklist

- **Protect:** Are you ensuring all company work remains company property (**IP**)?
- **Secure:** Are you treating personal data with the maximum care it requires (**Privacy**)?
- **Act:** Are you making choices that follow the rules (Deontology) and benefit the organisation/society (Utilitarianism) (**Ethics**)?
