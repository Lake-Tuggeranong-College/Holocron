The core of Australian privacy law is the **Privacy Act 1988 (Cth)**, which includes the **13 Australian Privacy Principles (APPs)**. These principles govern how most private sector organisations (with an annual turnover of over $3 million, plus all health service providers and a few other specific entities) and all Australian government agencies must handle **Personal Identification Information (PII)**.

## 🛡️ What is Personal Identification Information (PII)?

PII, or **Personal Information**, is defined as information or an opinion about an **identified individual**, or an individual who is **reasonably identifiable**. It doesn't matter if the information is true or if it's recorded in a material form.

- **Examples of PII:** Name, address, phone number, email address, date of birth, driver's licence details, financial details (like bank account or tax file numbers), and medical records.
- **Sensitive Information:** A sub-set of PII that receives a higher level of protection. This includes information about an individual's health, racial or ethnic origin, religious or philosophical beliefs, sexual orientation, political opinions, or criminal record. Collecting sensitive information generally requires the individual's **consent**.

## 🏢 Workplace Application and the Employee Records Exemption

The application of the Privacy Act to the **workplace** is the most critical point for PII in this context, primarily due to the **employee records exemption**.

### 1. Private Sector Employee Records Exemption (The Key Exception)

In the **private sector**, the handling of a current or former employee's personal information is **exempt** from the Australian Privacy Principles (APPs) **if** the act or practice is **directly related** to the current or former employment relationship.

- **What this means:** For most day-to-day handling of employee PII—like managing payroll, performance, leave, or contact details—the employer **does not** have to comply with the APPs.
    - **Employee Record Examples:** Engagement, training, discipline, termination, terms and conditions, contact details, performance, salary, or superannuation affairs.
- **Alternative Protection:** Despite the exemption, other laws like the **Fair Work Act 2009** still require employers to keep certain employee records for seven years and give employees a right to **access and inspect** their own records.


##  PII **Exempt** from the APPs (Standard Employee Records)

In the **private sector**, the following PII, once collected and held as part of an employee record, is exempt from the APPs' rules on access, security, and disclosure (APPs 6, 11, 12, 13) **if** the handling is directly related to the employment relationship.

|**PII Category**|**Specific Examples of Exempt Records**|**Relevant APP Principle(s) Exempted**|
|---|---|---|
|**Personal Details**|Employee's home address, personal mobile number, emergency contact details (names/numbers).|All APPs, but particularly Access/Correction (APP 12 & 13)|
|**Employment History**|Signed contract of employment, records of training completed, resignation letter, termination documentation.|Use/Disclosure (APP 6)|
|**Financial/Tax**|Employee's Tax File Number (TFN), bank account details for payroll, superannuation fund details, salary/wage records.|Security (APP 11)|
|**Health & Leave**|Records of sick leave taken, doctor's certificate for medical leave, medical information necessary for a workers' compensation claim.|Collection (APP 3) _Note: This is sensitive info, but its collection for a primary employment purpose becomes exempt once part of the record._|
|**Performance/Conduct**|Performance review documents, formal disciplinary warnings, investigation notes related to conduct.|Use/Disclosure (APP 6)|

> **Key Exception Note:** While these are exempt from the _Privacy Act_ for private employers, the **Fair Work Act** and other state/territory laws still require employers to keep and allow the employee to **access** their own employment records.

### 2. When the APPs _Do_ Apply in the Private Sector

The employee records exemption has significant limits, meaning the APPs apply to certain PII handling in the workplace:

- **Job Applicants:** Personal information of **unsuccessful job candidates** (CVs, references, contact details) is **not** covered by the exemption and must be handled according to the APPs.
- **Non-Employment Purposes:** If an employer uses PII for a purpose **not directly related** to the employment relationship (e.g., selling an employee list for marketing), the APPs apply.
- **Contractors and Volunteers:** The exemption generally **does not** apply to information held about independent contractors or volunteers.
- **Post-Employment Disclosure (References):** Providing an employment reference is generally considered directly related to the employment relationship and is exempt, though it is best practice to seek the individual's consent.

## 2. PII **NOT Exempt** from the APPs (Must Comply)

These examples fall outside the narrow "directly related to current or former employment" rule, meaning a private sector employer **must** follow all 13 APPs when handling this information.

|**PII Category**|**Specific Examples Requiring APP Compliance**|**Rationale**|
|---|---|---|
|**Prospective Employees**|CVs, referees' contact details, academic transcripts, and interview notes for **unsuccessful job applicants**.|The individual is not a current or former employee, so the exemption does not apply. Must be collected via fair means (APP 3) and securely destroyed/de-identified when no longer needed (APP 11).|
|**Contractors/Volunteers**|Personal information (e.g., driver's licence, bank details, contact info) of **non-employee** contractors, consultants, or volunteers.|There is no 'employment relationship' as defined by the exemption. Must comply with APPs, including having a clear Privacy Policy (APP 1) and providing a collection notice (APP 5).|
|**Commercial Use of Data**|Using an internal employee email list to market a non-work product or service (e.g., selling the list to a third-party marketer).|The act is **not directly related** to the employment relationship. This would breach APP 6 (Use/Disclosure) and potentially APP 7 (Direct Marketing).|
|**Disclosure for Non-Work**|A manager emails 100 staff members with an employee's full name, medical condition, and hospital details after a non-work incident.|The disclosure is **not directly related** to the employee's employment and breaches APP 6. (Source: OAIC ruling example).|
|**New Biometric Collection**|A new policy requiring employees to provide a fingerprint (biometric data) to clock on for the first time.|Some interpretations (like in the _Lee v Superior Wood_ case) have argued that the **collection** of new, sensitive data (like a fingerprint) is not yet part of a "record held by the organisation," and therefore must comply with the collection rules of APP 3, which requires consent for sensitive information.|


## Sensitive Information (Needs Consent or Exception)

This subset of PII requires extra protection. **Even if** it becomes part of an employee record, its collection still typically requires explicit consent, unless a legal exception applies (like Work Health and Safety obligations).

|**Sensitive PII Category**|**Example in the Workplace**|**Requirement**|
|---|---|---|
|**Health Information**|Results from mandatory pre-employment medical checks (for specific roles), records of disability/reasonable adjustments, results of drug and alcohol testing.|Requires **consent** from the individual unless necessary to prevent a serious threat to life/health (APP 3) or authorised by law (e.g., WHS laws).|
|**Biometric Information**|Fingerprint scans, facial recognition data, voice prints used for time clocking or access control.|Requires **consent** for collection and use, as it is highly sensitive PII.|
|**Trade Union Membership**|Recording an employee's decision to join a trade union.|Requires **consent** for collection, though it is usually covered by the employee records exemption once collected.|


### 3. Public Sector Employees

For **Australian Government agencies**, the **employee records exemption does not apply**. Therefore, the APPs **do** apply to the PII of all current and former government employees.

## 📌 Core Obligations Under the Australian Privacy Principles (APPs)

When the APPs **do** apply (e.g., to job applicants, non-employee-related data, or in the public sector), the obligations for handling PII are:

- **APP 3 (Collection):** Only collect PII that is **reasonably necessary** for the organisation's functions or activities. Sensitive information requires consent.
- **APP 5 (Notice):** Organisations must provide a **privacy notice** at the time of or before collecting PII, explaining what information is being collected, why, who it will be shared with, and how the individual can access or correct it.
- **APP 6 (Use/Disclosure):** Use or disclose PII only for the **primary purpose** for which it was collected, or a directly related, reasonably expected secondary purpose (unless an exception or consent applies).
- **APP 11 (Security)

:** Take reasonable steps to protect PII from misuse, interference, loss, and unauthorised access, modification, or disclosure. When no longer needed, the information must be securely destroyed or de-identified.

- **APP 12 & 13 (Access/Correction):** Individuals have the right to **access** their PII and request its **correction**.

## 🚨 Mandatory Data Breach Notification

Organisations covered by the Privacy Act must comply with the **Notifiable Data Breaches (NDB) scheme**. If a data breach occurs that is **likely to result in serious harm** to any individual whose PII is involved, the organisation must notify:

1. The **Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC)**.
2. The **affected individuals**.
