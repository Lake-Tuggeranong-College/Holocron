# Level Up: Why the ICT30120 Certificate III is Your Smartest Career Move

If you're finishing school and wondering what’s next, you've probably heard the same advice: "Go to uni." But while thousands of graduates are struggling to find work, the tech industry is practically begging for people to join the workforce.

Here is why the **ICT30120 Certificate III in Information Technology** is the ultimate fast track for your career in 2026.

### 1. Earn While They’re Still Studying

The biggest myth is that you need a 3-year degree to get a "real" job.

- **The Salary Gap:** Current 2026 market data shows that entry-level IT Support Technicians in Canberra now earn an average of **$75,000 – $80,000** [^1] [^7].
- **VET vs. Uni:** Research from _Jobs and Skills Australia_ shows that **78% of VET graduates** find work immediately after training. In the tech sector, VET graduates often out-earn Bachelor degree holders in their first two years due to having more practical, hands-on experience [^2].

### 2. High Demand = Job Security

The tech sector is currently considered "recession-proof" in Australia.

- **The 186,000 Worker Gap:** To hit the national goal of 1.2 million tech jobs by 2030, Australia is currently **186,000 workers behind schedule** [^3].
- **The APS Shortfall:** The Australian Public Service (APS) is facing a specific talent gap of **8,000 digital roles** by 2030. They have explicitly stated that "university graduates alone won't fill the gap" and are looking for VET-qualified staff [^4].

### 3. The Price Tag: Why LTC is a Massive Win

If you wait until you graduate high school to do this course, it could cost you thousands.

**Indicative Cost Comparison (ICT30120):**

| **Provider**                 | **Enrollment Type**     | **Estimated Cost (AUD)** |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------ |
| **Lake Tuggeranong College** | **High School Student** | **$0 (Fully Funded)**    |
| **CIT (Canberra)**           | Standard / Full Fee     | **$2,695 – $8,040** [^5] |
| **TAFE (NSW/VIC)**           | Full Fee Paying         | **$4,116 – $7,546** [^6] |
| **Private RTO**              | Fee-for-Service         | **$3,000 – $8,000**      |

_By doing it at LTC, you secure your qualification for free while completing your Senior Secondary Certificate._

### 4. Career Path Comparison (The "Fast Track")

| **Feature**     | **The Uni Path (Bachelor)** | **The ICT30120 Path (Cert III)** |
| --------------- | --------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Time to Job** | 3–4 Years                   | **6–12 Months**                  |
| **Debt**        | $30k+ HECS-HELP Debt        | **$0 at LTC**                    |
| **Experience**  | Mostly Theory               | **Hands-on / Practical**         |

### 5. Future-Proofing Against AI

AI isn't taking these jobs; it's making them more important. The _Jobs and Skills Report 2025_ confirms that AI is "augmenting" work, creating a massive need for people who can configure and manage these systems [^2].
