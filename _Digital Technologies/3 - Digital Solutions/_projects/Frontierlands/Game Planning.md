Following on from the FPS analysis, it's now time to decide and document the specifics of the game.

# Game Mechanics

Game mechanics need to be decided on, and documented.

Questions to guide:
- How does the player win?
- How does the player lose?
- How many levels?
	- Do the different levels have different themes?
- How much HP does the player start with?
- How much HP does the player lose when shot?
- How much HP do the enemies start with?
- How much HP do the enemies lose when shot?

etc.
etc.

# Player Loop

In game mechanics design, a player loop refers to a sequence of actions that players repeatedly perform throughout gameplay to achieve their goals or progress through the game. It encompasses a series of interconnected activities that provide a sense of reward, motivation, and engagement.

**Components of a Player Loop:**

- **Action:** The player's interaction with the game world, which can include movement, combat, puzzles, or social interactions.
- **Feedback:** The immediate response from the game to the player's actions, such as damage indicators, item drops, or character prompts.
- **Reward:** The tangible or intangible benefits players receive for completing actions, such as experience points, loot, or narrative progression.
- **Progression:** The incremental advancement of players' skills, abilities, or status within the game, as a result of repeatedly completing the player loop.
- **Motivation:** The underlying driving force or desire that compels players to continue engaging in the player loop, such as the pursuit of power, completionism, or social recognition.

**Types of Player Loops:**

- **Combat Loops:** Focus on engaging players in combat-centric actions, providing immediate feedback and rewards for successful battles.
- **Loot Loops:** Center around the collection and acquisition of loot, incentivizing players to explore and engage in gameplay to obtain valuable items.
- **Progression Loops:** Driven by the gradual advancement of player characters or progress through the game's narrative, providing long-term motivation and a sense of accomplishment.
- **Social Loops:** Encourage players to interact and collaborate with each other, fostering a sense of community and providing intrinsic rewards.
- **Discovery Loops:** Emphasize exploration and the uncovering of new areas, secrets, or gameplay elements, instilling a sense of wonder and discovery.

**Significance of Player Loops:**

- **Engagement:** Well-designed player loops keep players engaged and motivated, maximizing gameplay sessions and player retention.
- **Reward and Progression:** They provide a sense of accomplishment and progress, satisfying players' psychological needs.
- **Mastery and Skill:** Repeatedly engaging in player loops allows players to develop their skills and improve their mastery of the game's mechanics.
- **Customization and Choice:** Player loops offer opportunities for customization and choice, allowing players to tailor their gameplay experience to their preferences.
- **Game Design Iteration:** Analyzing player loop data can help developers understand player behavior and make informed design decisions to improve gameplay.

# Player Feedback

**Player Feedback in Game Mechanics Design**

Player feedback refers to the information and responses provided to players during gameplay that guide their actions, decisions, and overall experience. It is an essential element of game mechanics design, as it helps players understand the game's rules, make informed choices, and progress effectively.

**Types of Player Feedback:**

- **Visual Feedback:** This includes graphical indicators, animations, and visual cues that provide immediate feedback on player actions. For example, damage numbers popping up when an enemy is hit, or a progress bar indicating the completion of a task.
- **Audio Feedback:** Sounds and music can also convey feedback. For example, a satisfying sound effect when a weapon is fired, or ominous music indicating an approaching enemy.
- **Tactile Feedback:** In some games, physical sensations can provide feedback. For example, vibration controllers or force feedback steering wheels can simulate the impact of collisions or the weight of a weapon.
- **Textual Feedback:** On-screen text messages, dialogue boxes, or tutorials provide clear and concise information to players. This can include instructions, quest updates, or character stats.

**Importance of Player Feedback:**

- **Clarity and Understanding:** Player feedback helps players understand the game's mechanics, rules, and objectives. It clarifies what actions they can take, what consequences their actions have, and how to progress.
- **Decision-Making:** Feedback informs players' decisions by providing information about their current state, available options, and potential outcomes. This allows them to make strategic choices and adapt their gameplay accordingly.
- **Skill Development:** Feedback helps players develop their skills by providing opportunities to learn from their mistakes and improve their performance. For example, damage indicators can help players adjust their aim or timing.
- **Engagement and Immersion:** Well-designed player feedback enhances engagement by providing a sense of responsiveness and immersion. It makes players feel connected to the game world and invested in their actions.
- **User Experience:** Player feedback contributes to a positive user experience by ensuring that players can easily understand and interact with the game. It reduces frustration and allows players to focus on enjoying the gameplay.

**Example of Player Feedback in Action:**

In a first-person shooter game, when the player fires their weapon, they receive visual feedback in the form of a muzzle flash and recoil animation. They also receive audio feedback in the form of a gunshot sound effect. This feedback provides immediate confirmation that their action was successful and gives them a sense of impact and realism.
