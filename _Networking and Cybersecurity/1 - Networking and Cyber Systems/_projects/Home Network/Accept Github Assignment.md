# Accept GitHub Assignment

First, log into GitHub using your school Google account.

Click on the link to the GitHub Classroom assignment:

> [!note] https://classroom.github.com/a/pBy2ToQa

This process creates a [[Repository|repository]] which you will use throughout this semester to maintain your project files.

# Clone Repository

We are going to [[clone]] your project. Think of **cloning** as downloading a live version of your school assignment folder that stays connected to GitHub so you can turn in your work easily.

> [!info] Github desktop is the GUI interface to clone, commit, push etc repositories to and from Github that runs on your local computer.


Now, open **Github Desktop** on your computer and click "Clone Repository" under the File menu.

Select the new repository you just created on GitHub.

> [!important] Choose the repo you just created, not the one shown.

Choose the path where you want to save it.

> [!tip] The directory will need to be empty.


Click Clone.
