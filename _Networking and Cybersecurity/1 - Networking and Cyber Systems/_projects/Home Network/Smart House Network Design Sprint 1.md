# Project Overview

This semester-long course introduces students to the fundamentals of networking and programming with the end-goal to build a secure automated home network.

The networking topics that will be relevant are:
- [[Networking Models]]
- [[TCP & UDP]]
- [[Subnetting]]
- Packet Tracer

The programming topics you will learn are:
- [[Internet of Things (IoT)]] devices
- Python programming
- Sensors (input)
- Actuators (output)


# Objectives

Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:

- Understand the OSI model and its role in network communication.
- Configure basic network settings on their computers.
- Subnet IP addresses and apply subnet masks.
- Identify different network topologies.
- Use Packet Tracer to simulate and troubleshoot network configurations.
- Code IoT devices to integrate sensors and actuators.



> [!info] This is sprint 1 of the project. The deadline for this sprint is Week 7.

# Home network design

In packet tracer, you'll develop a home network to support a smart house, with computing devices (PCs, laptops, tablets etc) as well as 'smart' devices such as a system to monitor and control the temperature in the house.

# Step 1 - Network Configuration

Add the following devices to the network:


| Device                    | Amount | Notes                                                  |
| ------------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| WRT300N (wireless router) | 1      |                                                        |
| PC                        | 3      | Each `FastEthernet0` interface should be set to DHCP   |
| Wireless                  | 3      | Remove existing card, and add `WPC300N`to each laptop. |
 
 The network should appear similar to this:

Check the network by running a ping command from one device to another, such as from a laptop to a PC.

# Automated Devices

## Requirements

Prior to continuing with this stage of the project, there are some topics that are required reading:

- [[Shared Content/softwareDevFundamentals/_slides/Decisions|Decisions]]
- [[Shared Content/softwareDevFundamentals/_slides/Loops|Loops]]
- [[Modularisation]]

## Simple 'Smart' Lamp

In this first stage, this lamp is not 'smart' or automated in any way. It will simply be a lamp attached to a switch through a microcontroller.

### Wiring Components


First, add the Lamp to the network. You'll find a prebuilt lamp 'thing' in `End Drives` -> `Home` as shown below.

![[smartLightsFindLamp.png]]

Next, add in a Microcontroller Unit (MCU), found in `Components` -> `Boards`:

![[smartLightsFindMCU.png]]

The last component to add for this system is the on/off switch. This component can be found under `Component`-> `Sensors`.

![[smartLightsFindSwitch.png]]

Now it's time to connect the components. Use the `Connections` -> `Connections` -> `IoT Custom Cable` to connect the devices.

![[smartLightsFindIoTCable.png]]

When connecting the devices, connect `D0` on the lamp to `D1` on the MCU. Connect the MCU `D0` to pin `D0` on the switch, as shown below.

> [!info] D0, D1 are examples of pins to connect devices to the MCU/Components. This is an equivalent concept as with Arduinos with digital pins.

### Programming the MCU

> [!info] MCU stands for MicroController Unit. An Arduino is an example of a microcontroller unit.

Click on the MCU and change to the Programming tab. Select the default `Blink (Javascript)` file and choose delete. When asked if you are sure you want to delete click Yes.
![[smartLightsDeleteBlink.png]]
Create a new script by clicking the `New` button. Give the project a name, such as `Smart Light` and set the Template to `Empty - Python`. 

![[smartLightsNewProject.png]]

Click Create.

Double click `main.py` to open the file, which will be blank. Replace the contents with the following code.

```python
from gpio import * # imports all modules in the GPIO library
from time import * # imports all modules in the time library

switchValue = 0 # initialize Switch sensor value global variable to 0

def readFromSensors():
	global switchValue # declare switchValue as global
	global speakerValue # declare potentiometerValue as global
	switchValue = digitalRead(0) # read Switch sensor value

def writeToActuators():
	if (switchValue == HIGH): # evaluates to True if the Switch sensor value is digital HIGH, otherwise false
		customWrite(1, "2") # turn on the Light
	else:
		customWrite(1, "0") # turn off the Light

def main(): # defines the main function
	pinMode(0, IN) # sets digital slot 0 (Switch) to input
	pinMode(1, OUT) # sets digital slot 1 (Light) to output

	while True: # loop indefinitely
		readFromSensors() # call the readFromSensors function
		writeToActuators() # call the writeToActuators function
		delay(1000) # delay script execution for 1000 ms

if __name__ == "__main__": # Evaluates to True if this module is the script being executed, otherwise False if this module is being imported into another module
	main() # call the main function
```

Press the Run button to execute the script.

> [!info]- Code Explanation
> 
This code is a simple example of controlling a light based on the input from a switch sensor. It uses the General Purpose Input/Output (GPIO) library and the time library. Here's a breakdown of what each part does:
> 
>  **Importing Libraries:**
> ```
> from gpio import * # imports all modules in the GPIO library
> from time import * # imports all modules in the time library
> ```
> 
> **Global Variable Initialisation:**
> 
> ```
> switchValue = 0 # initialize Switch sensor value global variable to 0
> ```
> **Reading from Sensors:** The `readFromSensors` function reads the value from the switch sensor and stores it in the global variable `switchValue`.
> ```
> def readFromSensors():
> 	global switchValue # declare switchValue as global
> 	switchValue = digitalRead(0) # read Switch sensor value
> ```
> **Writing to Actuators:** The `writeToActuators` function turns the light on or off based on the value of `switchValue`.
> ```
> def writeToActuators():
> 	if (switchValue == HIGH): # evaluates to True if the Switch sensor value is digital HIGH, otherwise false
> 	customWrite(1, "2") # turn on the Light
> else:
> 	customWrite(1, "0") # turn off the Light
> ```
> 
> **Main Function:** The `main` function sets up the pins for the switch and light, then enters an infinite loop where it continuously reads the sensor values and updates the actuators.
> 
> ```
> def main(): # defines the main function
> 	pinMode(0, IN) # sets digital slot 0 (Switch) to input
> 	pinMode(1, OUT) # sets digital slot 1 (Light) to output
> 
> 	while True: # loop indefinitely
> 		readFromSensors() # call the readFromSensors function
> 		writeToActuators() # call the writeToActuators function
> 		delay(1000) # delay script execution for 1000 ms
> ```
>     
> 2. **Execution:** The code checks if it is being run as the main module and, if so, calls the `main` function.
> 
> ```
> if __name__ == "__main__": # Evaluates to True if this module is the script being executed, otherwise False if this module is being imported into another module
> 	main() # call the main function
> ```
> 
> **Mermaid Flowchart**
> 
> Here's a Mermaid flowchart to visualise the flow of the program:
> 
> ```mermaid
> graph TD
>     A[Start] --> B[Set pin 0 to input]
>     B --> C[Set pin 1 to output]
>     C --> D[Infinite Loop]
>     D --> E[Read switch value]
>     E --> F{Switch value HIGH?}
>     F -->|Yes| G[Turn on light]
>     F -->|No| H[Turn off light]
>     G --> I[Wait 1 second]
>     H --> I[Wait 1 second]
>     I --> D
> ```
> 
> This flowchart shows the process from setting up the pins, reading the sensor value, updating the light, and waiting for a second before repeating the process in an infinite loop.


Close the window.

Holding ALT key, click on the switch to turn it On. After a brief pause, the lamp will turn on.

# Automating Devices

Packet Tracer, along with networking devices, can also simulate IoT devices, such as Arduinos and Raspberry Pis.
