# Project Overview
**Project Goal:**

The goal of this project is to design and develop an engaging and educational Capture the Flag (CTF) game that revolves around core cybersecurity concepts. This game will provide students with a hands-on, gamified experience to enhance their understanding of cybersecurity principles and techniques.

**Project Description:**

The CTF game will consist of a series of challenges and puzzles that test students' knowledge and skills in cybersecurity domains such as:

- Network security
- Web application security
- Cryptography
- Incident response
- Password cracking
- Forensics

Students will be divided into teams and compete against each other to solve these challenges. Each challenge will be designed to reflect real-world cybersecurity scenarios, fostering critical thinking and problem-solving abilities.
