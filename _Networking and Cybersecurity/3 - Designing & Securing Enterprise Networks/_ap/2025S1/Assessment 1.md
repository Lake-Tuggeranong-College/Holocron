Instead of saying the challenge needs to work, specify what 'work' means. It could be the arduino needs to publish data, or host a website with a hidden file etc.

**Consider data** in the system for the challenges. The [ESP Feathers ](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3405) are capable of interfacing with sensors (like temperature sensors) and actuators (e.g. motors, lights etc). They can publish data to the database, receive data from the database, or store data. The players of the game may need to access or intercept some of this data to complete the challenges.

Feathers can also have addon '[wings](https://www.adafruit.com/category/943)'. Look at the available ones for ideas.
