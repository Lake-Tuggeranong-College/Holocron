# Objective/s

In this stage you will, as a group, plan the end goals for the project. This may include:

- The visual design of the CTF site
- The visual design of the CTF challenges page
- The theme of the game. E.g.:
	- Rebels hacking the Death Star
	- Country A hacking Country B
	- etc.
- The data the Arduino-based devices will publish
- The data the Arduino-based devices will receive
- The physical output based on the data received by the Arduino-based devices. E.g.
	- The windmill turns on / off
	- The garage door opens / closes
	- The traffic lights 'break' (turn all red)
	- etc.
- Docker instances required
- The specific vulnerabilities included in all challenges.
- A flag for each challenge.

It is important to note that ALL CTF challenges require the use of a Arduino-based devices and/or a docker instance.
