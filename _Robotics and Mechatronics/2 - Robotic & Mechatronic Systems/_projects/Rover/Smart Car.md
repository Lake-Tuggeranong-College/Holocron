# Project Overview

This project invites students to design and build a remote control car system, emphasizing robust wireless communication and embedded programming. You'll use the Adafruit Feather RP2040 RFM95 board as the central microcontroller for both the car and its remote, leveraging its integrated LoRa radio module to establish long-range, low-power communication. Through this hands-on experience, you'll explore concepts such as Arduino programming, radio frequency communication protocols, motor control, power management, and user interface design for the remote, culminating in a fully functional, wirelessly controlled vehicle.
