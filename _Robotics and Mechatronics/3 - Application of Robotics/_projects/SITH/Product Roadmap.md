# Objective

As a group, plan out the implementation, as a best-guess, for the project. Create a Product Roadable table which defines the different functionality or major components of the project. 

This could include (but not limited to) particular output of the product, such as a robot car moving forward and backward, or the development of a back-end server.


# Instructions

The following is a generic set of instructions for the process to develop the roadmap.

# Deliverable

The document is to be written in markdown and included in the Holocron repository/website.

It can be co-developed using Google Docs (for example), however the final version needs to be converted to markdown.

> [!important]- Google Docs can export to Markdown (.md) files.
