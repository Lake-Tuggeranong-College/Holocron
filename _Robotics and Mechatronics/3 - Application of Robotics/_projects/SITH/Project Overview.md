# Project Overview: SITH (Systems Integration & Telemetry Handler)

## 1. What's the Project About?

The **SITH** project is all about creating a powerful system that will help us manage and analyse data from our robots in a centralised way. Think of it like setting up a super-efficient internet connection for all our robots! SITH aims to collect data from every robot, make sense of it, and use it to improve their performance.

## 2. What's the Goal of SITH?

The main reason we're building SITH is so that we can create a system that will grow with us as new robots and more data become available. This system will do three main things:

1. **Standardise How Robots Communicate:** We'll create universal rules for how all our robots send and receive information about their status, location, and condition.
2. **Keep Data Safe and Intact:** All this data will be stored in a secure, centralised database, so we have one accurate and consistent history to analyse and report on.
3. **Make It Easy for Other Programs to Use:** SITH acts as a secure gateway that lets our analysis tools, mission control systems, and other programs easily access and use the combined data stream.

## 3. What Can We Expect?

When SITH is up and running, we'll have some powerful advantages:

* **Troubleshooting Made Easier:** We can fix robots before they break down by spotting warning signs in the live telemetry.
* **More Efficient Use of Resources:** With accurate, unified data, we can plan tasks, assign routes, and make decisions much better.
* **Simplified Reporting:** We'll have one place to look at reports on robot performance, usage, and health, making it easier to keep track of everything.
