# Project Overview: SITH (Systems Integration & Telemetry Handler)

## 1. Executive Summary

The **Systems Integration & Telemetry Handler (SITH)** project is our main plan to build a powerful, **centralised** data system for our robots. Think of it as creating the internet for our entire fleet! SITH’s goal is to take all the different bits of data (called **telemetry**) from every single robot and bring them into one main, organised system. This lets us monitor their status live, predict when a robot might break down, and make sure every robot is **optimised** to do its job properly.

## 2. Project Objective

The main reason for building SITH is to create a strong system that can grow as we get more robots and data. This system will:
1. **Standardise Telemetry:** We will **standardise** how all the robots talk. This means creating one set of universal rules for sending live information—like where the robot is, how healthy it is, and if it has any errors.
2. **Ensure Data Integrity:** We'll gather all this data into one secure, **centralised** database. This way, we always have the same, accurate history for analysis and reports—it's the **single source of truth**.
3. **Facilitate Integration:** The SITH system will also act as a secure gateway (the 'Handler'). This lets other programmes we use, like our analysis tools and mission control systems, easily grab and use the combined data stream.

## 3. Expected Outcomes

When SITH is successfully deployed, it will give us major advantages:

- **Proactive Maintenance:** We’ll be able to fix robots _before_ they break down by seeing warning signs in the live telemetry.
- **Operational Efficiency:** We can assign tasks and plan routes much better using accurate, unified data, meaning better work and less wasted time.
- **Clearer Reports:** We will have one central spot to run all reports on robot performance, usage, and health, making everything easier to track.
