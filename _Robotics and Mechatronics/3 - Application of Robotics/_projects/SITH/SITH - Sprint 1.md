# Objective

This sprint of the project developed is aimed at developing the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) from the Project Roadmap.

Using the GitHub Project jobs board, keep track of the tasks that are actively being developed, and yet to be developed.

# First Steps - Fork & Clone Repository

Log into Github, using the account you've used previously (or create a new account!). 

Click on the link to the main repository for the project.

> [!danger] https://github.com/Lake-Tuggeranong-College/sith-robotics

Click the fork project by clicking the fork button.

Create the fork in your account, by setting the owner to you, and give the repo a name (easy to keep it the same as the main repo). Press **Create Fork**.

Clone the repository to your computer using GitHub Desktop (or any method). Choose the newly created repository

> [!info] Github desktop is the GUI interface to clone, commit, push etc repositories to and from Github that runs on your local computer.


Now, open **Github Desktop** on your computer and click "Clone Repository" under the File menu.

Select the new repository you just created on GitHub.

Choose the path where you want to save it.

> [!tip] The directory will need to be empty.


Click Clone.

> [!danger] Make note of where you cloned the repository to your device. You will need it later on.

# Project Workflow

Unlike previous projects, possibly, this project requires you to have your own 'fork' of the repository. This means you have ownership and control of your fork (or version). When you complete a section of the project (e.g. code functionality), you will need to create a Pull Request (PR). 

A pull request is a message sent to the owner of the main repository (for e.g. Lake Tuggeranong College) that you have updates that you wish to be *pulled* into the main repository. If accepted, your changes will be merged with the main repository. All other users will be able to see the changes, and update their forks with your new code.

# Open in Visual Studio Code

Open Visual Studio Code. Choose File -> Open Folder and choose the folder you cloned the repository into. 

Hopefully, you will see some files and directories on the left hand side, and then a pop up will appear, simiular to shown in the image. Click **Reopen in Container**.

> [!danger] The first time you open the project in a container, it could take a long time.
