### What is `sudo`?

`sudo` stands for **"superuser do"**. It lets a **regular user** run commands with **administrator (root) privileges**.

Think of it like asking for permission to do something important on your computer—like installing software or changing system settings.

### 🔐 Why is `sudo` important?

Linux is designed to be secure. It separates regular users from the **root user**, who has full control over the system. This helps prevent accidental or malicious changes.

Using `sudo` ensures:

- Only trusted users can make system-level changes.
- You don’t have to log in as root (which is risky).
- Every `sudo` command is logged for security.
